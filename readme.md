'sayo trans public' is aiming for helping mtf transgender people and publicizing transgender information.

i do all these things because i love the mtf group, people there are friendly, interesting and really cute. so i want to do something for the people i love, and my same kind.

i want to tell them how to be cute, how to feel love, how to live better and how to finish this game. i also wish them to be happy, confident, optimistic and feel proud to be a transgender.
